## Requirements

- [PHP] 8.1 or above
- [Composer]
- [Lando]


## Usage

Run the following command (*replacing "my-new-website" with your website's slug*):

```sh
composer create-project fivefifteen/basis my-new-website
```

The [setup script](setup.php) will ask you a few questions (*feel free to mash enter and leave everything with default values*) and when it's finished the URL to the local version of your new website will be displayed.

Visiting that URL will show you the WordPress setup screen where you can create your admin user account and then log in to the WordPress dashboard.

See your site's newly generated [readme.md](readme.template.md) on what to do from there.


## Configuration

The default values for any of the questions that are asked by the [setup script](setup.php) can be configured by setting an environment variable with the `BASIS_` prefix:

```sh
export BASIS_SOPS_AGE_KEY="age1ql3z7hjy54pw3hyww5ayyfg7zqgvc7w3j2elw8zmrj2kg5sfn9aqmcac8p"
```
